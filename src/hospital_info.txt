We look forward to this.  2) Thank you also for looking into the best process for the future maintenance of the current cardiac and Heme/onc BoC programs. Best for us are the options of: credit card payment upon order placement, ACH credit, or the establishment of a Maintenance Fund (see attached Q&A) 3) Attached is the information to start a new program.  a. NICU: $5000 (materials, on-site training, staff self-reflection workshop, and opportunity for education credits) b. BURN: (restart): $4500 (consecutive start up) c. Chronic??? $4500 (consecutive start up---a Chronic Start up can outfit 3 areas for BoC programming implementation) d. $500 initial dues for new programming i. For 2017, we can forward an invoice for $1500--- Annually capped at $1500-new program, existing cardiac and existing HO @ $500 each) e. Program maintenance: Typically we see larger programs requiring $3000-5000 in materials annually.  i. If interested in a maintenance fund with BOC (the restricted fund specifically for BOC programs at your hospital), we would start with $1500 per program to be replenished when the balance reaches $500. Annual report of this account sent to you.  f. Please also note the additional programming for patients, family and clinicians included in this information. The main contract licenses the hospital to use these additional programs and the current pricing is included on the documents. You can reach out to me for additional information.  4) Once our 2017 agreements are finalized—very soon-- I will prepare for you and include the 4 BoC programs, existing Cardiac and Heme/onc for renewal and the start of NICU and Burn BoC programs. Best if we have the “Critical information form” embedded in the file attached called Starting a new BoC partnership or program 5) Attached current Bead Prescriptions for Cardiac, Heme/onc, NICU and Chronic Programs. appreciate your compliance with the program copyright and restricted use of intellectual property.The Cardiac and Hematology programs should update their programs if these are not currently in use.
